The A* Algorithm is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is widely used in games and navigation systems to find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles

It combines:
- Dijkstra’s algorithm (for shortest path)
- Greedy Best-First Search (for Heuristic-based Exploration)

The formula used is:
plaintext
F = G + H

- G = cost from start to current Node
- H = estimated cost from current node to goal (Heuristic)

- F = total estimated cost of the path through the current node
